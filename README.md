# Blockstack Todo App

> A simple Vue.js Todo app built for the decentralized web.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
# previously we used yarn install. This is no longer supported.
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

```

### Running with the Blockstack Test Environment

First follow the above steps to setup the `blockstack-todo` application.

The `blockstack-todo` is easiest to develop against a [`regtest`](https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/regression-test-mode) bitcoin environment. There are a [couple of ways](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-core/tree/master/integration_tests#getting-started-with-docker) to setup the environment, but the easiest is through the [`docker`](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) setup. To use it first [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and `docker-compose` (comes with the `docker` install on MacOS and Windows, but is a separate install on linux: `apt-get install docker-compose`)

To get started make sure you stop any running Blockstack applications:

- On MacOS: Exit the Blockstack App running in the menu bar. If you were using the CLI you will also need to run `blockstack api stop`
- On Windows: Exit the Blockstack App and stop any running containers.
- On Linux: Stop any containers running the browser or API and if you were using the CLI run `blockstack api stop`

Then you are ready to start up the test environment:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

The first time you run this command it will download the current stable docker images for [browser](https://quay.io/repository/blockstack/blockstack-browser) (~380MB) and the [integration test framework](https://quay.io/repository/blockstack/integrationtests) (~380MB). This may take a while depending on your internet connection.

Once the images have downloaded containers will be created that run your regtest environment. You can see them by running `docker ps` in your terminal:

- `blockstacktodos_blockstack-api_1` has:
  * `bitcoind` node running in `regtest mode`
  * `blockstack-core` parses the `regtest` chain to build up the name database
  * Runs a `blockstack api` that is required for the `blockstack-browser`.
- `blockstacktodos_blockstack-browser_1` has:
  * The `blockstack-browser` server
- `blockstacktodos_cors-proxy_1`:
  * A [`CORS` proxy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/corsproxy)

The easiest way to work the regtest environment is in Incognito or Private Browsing mode in your browser. Open a private browsing window to [`localhost:8888`](http://localhost:8888) and setup your browser. In the first modal be sure to click `Advanced Pairing Mode`. Input the API Password as `blockstack_integration_test_api_password`:

Choose the default storage option to get started quickly.

> Optional:

> While not necessary you may want to register a name in the regtest environment. There are bitcoins in the wallet associated with the `blockstack api`. To transfer them to the browser wallet for use navigate to the wallet tab and copy the address. I should look something like `19WWRiJwkEcqX7HsWUSDFfi8zpTRoMMfx1`.

> Then open a new tab to [`localhost:8888/wallet/send-core`](http://localhost:8888/wallet/send-core) and input the browser wallet address and `blockstack_integration_test_api_password` into the respective fields. Click send and wait for the modals to indicate that the transaction has been processed.

> You will see the balance in your browser wallet and can use that to purchase names.

After that, make sure you have started your `blockstack-todo` application with the dev instructions in the first section. Open [`locahost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) and click the `Login` button. You will be redirected to a site on `blockstack.org` with a long auth string on the end:

```
https://blockstack.org/auth?authRequest=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOi...
```

Edit the url to replace `https://blockstack.org` with `locahost:8888`:

```
locahost:8888/auth?authRequest=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOi...
```

This will redirect you back to the browser to complete the signin flow. Now you have a full test environment ready to build Blockstack Apps.
